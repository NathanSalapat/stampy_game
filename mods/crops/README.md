This minetest mod expands the basic set of farming-related
crops that minetest_game offers. A list of crops/crafts is
below.

1. Melons

Melon plants grow from melon seeds. Once a plant is mature (there
are 5 stages) it will spawn a melon block adjacent to the plant.
The melon block can be harvested by punching, and yields 3-5
melon slices. The melon slice can be crafted to a melon seed.
